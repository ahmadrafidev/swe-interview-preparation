# SWE Interview Preparation

Welcome to my SWE Interview Preparation repository! This is where I store all my preparation materials for interviews with major tech companies like Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. Here, you'll find a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode (and similar website) and system design interview resources from various online sources.
